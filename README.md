# Exploring Boston's AirBnb data from 2016.

This project investigates Boston's AirBnB data from September 2016 - September 2017.

Project Motivation: Hosts on AriBnB are, traditionally, middle income individuals with a second property, with little to no experience in the holiday enconomy. Can we leverage insights from AirBnB Boston to enable these individuals to maximise their revenue from their properties, by understanding trends and important factors which contribute to the success of their venture.

File Description:
- exploration.ipynb: The main analysis and modelling notebook
- calendar.csv: Information about the calendar (or bookings), or upcoming bookings, for each listing in Boston.
