# Exploring Boston's AirBnb data from 2016.

This project investigates Boston's AirBnB data from September 2016 - September 2017.

Project Overview: What insights can we gather from Boston's open sourced AirBnb listings? Are there patterns in availability and/or price, and can we predict the occupancy of a listing, with the intention to help AirBnB hosts maximise their revenue from their property? This comprehensive explorartion of Boston's AirBnB data follows a rigorous framework, and addresses each of these questions. 

File Description:
- exploration.ipynb: The main analysis and modelling notebook
- calendar.csv: Information about the calendar (or bookings), or upcoming bookings, for each listing in Boston.
- listings.csv: Information about each listing in Boston
